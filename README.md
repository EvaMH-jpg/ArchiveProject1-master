## MOLO SONGOLOLO - A Magazine for and by children
The first edition of the iconic Molo Songololo Magazine appeared in 1980 promoting multi-culturalism, non-discrimination and diversity through children’s stories, drawings, poems and articles about children of the Cape. The magazine became popular amongst primary school children and teachers used it in the classroom as an alternative educational tool. For more than 20-years the Molo Songololo Magazine informed and educated children about their rights and responsibilities, current affairs, social and political developments; and created dialogue amongst children.

# <a name="RESEARCH"></a> 2. RESEARCH - "How to archive humans rights/ children's rights in an everchanging globalized world?"

In my research I included more sources than only the Molo Songololo Magazine. I am very interested in human rights in general and different happenings regarding this topic around the world and in different time periods. Therefore I gathered different contents and sources regarding this topic–leading to experiments with this content.


## <a name="Molo-Songololo "></a> Molo Songololo
#### History: 
As already mentioned above the magzine started its origin in 1980 in South Africa. It was established as a direct result of interventions by community workers during the 1979 United Nation’s International Year of the Child initiative to act against Apartheid policies and State actions against children; and to promote the rights and protection of children. Children from forced removal and migration settlements in Cape Town such as District Six, Elsies River and Crossroads were brought together to interact with each other, share experiences and learn from each other to breakdown Apartheid barriers and promote children's rights and equality. 

#### 1st issue Molo Songololo: MARCH 1980
During the 1980s Molo Songololo initiated and participated in various campaigns; such as the FREE THE CHILDREN Campaign - to free children from jail, INTERNATIONAL CHILDREN’S DAY Campaign - to promote the rights of the child, EQUAL EDUCATION Campaign - against Apartheid education; etc. Molo Songololo was seen as a CHAMPION FOR CHILDREN!

## 3. Timeline regarding important Human-Rights-happenings around the world

I created a Timeline in InDesign based on the [OHCHR-TIMELINE](https://at20.ohchr.org/timeline_full.html). I researched for the different events in history and marked the important ones within this document:

### Additional important documents

These documents are also part of my research. As I already meantioned I used a variety of resources in order to map out different events. It was an important part of my research to include as many different inputs regarding a certain time period or event as possible in order to understand what happened, who was involved, where it happened and why.
