## Artefact

### MOLO SONGOLOLO - A Magazine for and by children
The first edition of the iconic Molo Songololo Magazine appeared in 1980 promoting multi-culturalism, non-discrimination and diversity through children’s stories, drawings, poems and articles about children of the Cape. The magazine became popular amongst primary school children and teachers used it in the classroom as an alternative educational tool. For more than 20-years the Molo Songololo Magazine informed and educated children about their rights and responsibilities, current affairs, social and political developments; and created dialogue amongst children.

## Research - "How to archive human rights/ children's rights in an everchanging globalized world?"

In my research I included more sources than only the Molo Songololo Magazine. I am very interested in human rights in general and different happenings regarding this topic around the world, in different time periods. Therefore I gathered a variety of contents and sources regarding this topic–leading to experiments within this range.


### Molo Songololo


#### History: 
As already mentioned above the magzine started its origin in 1980 in South Africa. It was established as a direct result of interventions by community workers during the 1979 United Nation’s International Year of the Child initiative to act against Apartheid policies and State actions against children; and to promote the rights and protection of children. Children from forced removal and migration settlements in Cape Town such as District Six, Elsies River and Crossroads were brought together to interact with each other, share experiences and learn from each other to breakdown Apartheid barriers and promote children's rights and equality. 

#### 1st issue Molo Songololo: MARCH 1980
During the 1980s Molo Songololo initiated and participated in various campaigns; such as the FREE THE CHILDREN Campaign - to free children from jail, INTERNATIONAL CHILDREN’S DAY Campaign - to promote the rights of the child, EQUAL EDUCATION Campaign - against Apartheid education; etc. Molo Songololo was seen as a CHAMPION FOR CHILDREN!

## Report of the first National Conference on children's rights: 

Another very interesting source from the Archive is the "Report on the first National Conference on children's rights" and the corresponding Discussion Papers-"Children Have Rights".

## Timeline regarding important Human-Rights-happenings around the world

I created a Timeline in InDesign based on the [OHCHR-TIMELINE](https://at20.ohchr.org/timeline_full.html). I researched for the different events in history and marked the important ones within this document:

### Additional important documents

These documents are also part of my research. As I already meantioned I used a variety of resources in order to map out different events. It was an important part of my research to include as many different inputs regarding a certain time period or event as possible in order to understand what happened, who was involved, where it happened and why.

## Language as Material

[2](https://monoskop.org/media/text/goldsmith_2011_uncreative_writing/#filepos6014) [LANGUAGE AS MATERIAL](https://monoskop.org/media/text/goldsmith_2011_uncreative_writing/#filepos6105)

"Portions of “Language as Material” appeared in New Media Poetics (Cambridge: MIT, 2006) and was first written for the New Media Poetry Conference in October 2002 at the University of Iowa. Other parts of the chapter were given at Digital Poetics at SUNY Buffalo in 2000.

There’s been a lot of talk the past few years about net neutrality, a concept that argues either for or against assigning different values to the various types of data that flow through our networks. Net neutrality advocates claim that all data on the network be treated as equal, whether it be a piece of spam or a Nobel laureate’s speech. Their advocacy reminds me of the post office, which charges by the pound, not by what’s inside the package: you can’t charge more to send a couture dress than you can for a book of poetry just because it’s more valuable.

Uncreative writing mirrors the ethos of net neutral advocates, claiming that one way of treating language is materially, focusing on formal qualities as well as communicative ones, viewing it as a substance that moves and morphs through its various states and digital and textual ecosystems. Yet, like data, language works on several levels, endlessly flipping back and forth between the meaningful and the material: we can choose to weigh it *and* we can choose to read it. There’s nothing stable about it: even in their most abstracted form, letters are embedded with semantic, semiotic, historical, cultural, and associative meanings. Think of the letter *a*, and it’s anything but neutral. Associations for me include *The Scarlet Letter*, a top grade, the title of Louis Zukofsky’s life poem, Andy Warhol’s novel, and so forth. When nonobjectivist painters tried to rid painting of illusion and metaphor, you can see why they chose geometric forms, not letters, to do so.

Right now I am writing transparently: how I’m using words is supposed to be invisible to you so that you can follow what I’m saying. If, instead, I WAS TO WRITE IN ALL CAPS, I move into the material or oblique. You’d first notice the way it looked, then—noting that CAPS generally connote SHOUTING—its tone, and last, its message. In day-to-day life we rarely notice the material properties of language except for when, say, we encounter a stutterer or a person with a heavy accent, we first notice *how* they say, second we decode *what* they are saying.[1](https://monoskop.org/media/text/goldsmith_2011_uncreative_writing/#filepos653822) When we listen to an opera sung in a language we don’t understand, we push language’s formal properties to the front—its cadences and rhythms—choosing sound over sense. If we further choose to invert the transparency of words, we can hear them as sound or see them as shapes. One of modernism’s great aspirations was to skew language in this way, but the backlash it produced was equally strong: emphasizing its materiality disrupts normative flows of communication. Human beings have enough trouble understanding each other, critics complained. Why would we purposely want to make it more difficult?

In most literature, writers strive to strike a balance between these two states. A way to think of this is similar to the way the transparency slider bar in Photoshop functions: slide the bar far to the right and your image is 100 percent opaque; all the way to the left renders it barely visible, a ghost of its former self. In literature, if the slider is skewed toward complete transparency, language becomes functional discourse, the sort of language used to write a newspaper editorial or caption a photograph. Slide it back a little bit and it becomes prose: *Lo-lee-ta: the tip of the tongue taking a trip of three steps down the palate to tap, at three, on the teeth. Lo. Lee. Ta*. Nabokov’s opening hits a perfect note between sound and sense, signal and noise, poetry and narrative. After this dynamic opener, Nabokov moves the slider back toward sense, swapping it for a more transparent style in order to tell a story.

Two movements in the middle of the twentieth century, concrete poetry and situationism, experimented with sliding the slider all the way up at 100 percent opacity. In uncreative writing, new meaning is created by repurposing preexisting texts. In order to work with text this way, words must first be rendered opaque and material. Both movements viewed materiality as primary goals, the situationists through *détournement* and the concretists by literally treating letters as building blocks. The situationists worked in a variety of mediums, realizing their vision of the city as canvas whereas the concretists took a more traditional tact, mostly publishing books. By envisioning the page as a screen, the concretists anticipated the way we would work with language in the digital world half a century later."

## TRANSCODING

My first intention with the transcodings was to have a better understanding on all the research I collected– saying this I first thought I will work with all the collected material about human rights. During the process of narrating the material and experimentation with it I realized that I will have to narrow it down in order to understand the different aspects of my original Artefact the "Molo Songololo" Magazine. With the specific tools and trascodings I chose I am creating a frame for my project and myself in which the idea of an interactive game based on the magazine can grow. The purpose of the game is to educate and include children within their own rights. The ultimate goal is for children and young adults to understand and engage with their rights, based on the different aspects of the game. 


## Transcoding Nr.1: OCR - Image to Text 

### Description:
Since I was dealing with a lot of scans as material from the archive, I had to find a way to transcode this and only have a text file left.

### Method:
I checked different websites in order to find a way how to transcode this given scans, but they all did not work out too well.

### Tool: 
I created an OCR tool which scans my image and transforms it to a usable text file.

## Transcoding Nr.2: Image to 3D

### Description: 
As a next step I decided to create 3D images from certain cut outs of the magazine.

### Method: 
I started by going through the magazines and cut out a few images which represent the visual language of my artifact, in order for me to transcode them and turn them into a 3D object. 

 
 ### Tool: 
I worked with different tools here in order to transform this 2D image into a 3D object. First I cut out a certain part of the magazine. Then I edited it in Photoshop and placed it in Illustrator. I created a path out of the image. In order to be able to open it in Cinema 4D I had to save the file as Illustrator 8. Then I opened it in Cinema 4D–there you have the option to select all the layers and add a displacer to it. It will automatically make your 2D image into 3D.

## Transcoding Nr.3: Digital-Mapping: Non linear Timeline

### Description:
The idea was to create a non linear timeline in order to map out the events and happenings regarding human rights all over the world in different times and periods. Since my focus shifted towards the artefact and during my process I figured out that it is more important to focus on the different aspects of the magazine as material, I decided for my endresult to put the idea of the non linear timeline aside. I will continue working on this in a later stage of the process.

Fine example of Arnold Colom's rare double hemisphere map of the World, which appeared in his *Zee-Atlas*.

The map provides a fine depiction of the World. California is shown as an island, with a large landmass running due east and west to the north entitled Nova Albion, one of the only maps to provide this designation to this landmass (along with the map of his father Jacob Colom, published in 1650).

### Tool: 

I worked with Cinema 4D and Unity in order to create the first visual sketches for my non linear timeline. I wanted to create different islands which you can visit–on each island you find new information regarding human rights. I started to create the game in Unity with the first Island "Molo Songololo" which you can visit. Within the process I realized that the main focus, the Artefact, loses its importance and focus if I continue to work on the idea of the non-linear timeline.

## Reflection
Within the process of creating the transcodings as well as the tool (Unity game) I realized that certain things did not work out and I had the chance to reevaluate aspects of the progress and outcomes. Working with the Artefact was as interesting as challenging. It was important to understand the complexity of the material and highlight the research question within that working process in order to keep the main focus on my idea and the assignment. The experiments of cuting out content of the magazine and turning this 2d images into 3d gave me a better understanding of including them within the unity game and to create an intruiging point of view. 


## Outcome

It was quite clear from the beginning that my transcoding tool will be Unity, but the process to get to an endresult was quite long. As I already mentioned I started off by developing the idea of an non-linear timeline mapping out human events around the world in different times. During my visual developing process I realized that this is not the right way to go, especially considering that my artefact is a Magazine by children-for children. I changed the narrative of my game and developed a interactive field which applies the same visual language as the magazine, to my game. <br>
